                Here i'll post some writing or any other things that i made beside drawing, it maybe not look like it but actually i find myself quite "artful" (or not). I could play some music instrument but not that great, maybe like an elementary students level. Guitar is one of my favourite instrument since its most cheap (mine is IDR 500k) and sounds decent. I'll share every works that i did with guitar too with unproper quality (recorded on cheap chinese phone).

               This is a random tune that i play on C key with mainstream progression (the only one i know). Im actually quite satisfied with this one (even it's just looping same chorus). i love the oriental accent on this tune and combined with i dont know what its called guitar slap? or tap? its produce a bright and cheerful tune and i make it slower and sadder at the last part.  </P>

               First cover that i post in this blog. The song is Matt Redman's Famous song all the time, Bless The Lord or 10.000 Reasons. First Time i hear this song i wonder how can I actually bless the Lord? am I worthy enough? Even the Jews in the Bible cannt say Lord's name because they feel that they are unworthy to speak such a Sacred Name. John Piper said that as an act expressing grateful/thankfulness to the giver of "blessings", we thankful of what we are, what He was done in the past, now, and what will He do in the future. By Blessing the Lord, He will not become more powerful. But Lord can't praise/bless himself (He isn't narcistic), and the things that we could but God couldnt its giving praise to Him.<br> 
                
                <br>Psalm 34:1<br>"I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth."</P>

             Maaan, wasn't the title poetic? My friend suggested that title. Kinda cringy. But i love it because the melody is kinda bitter-sweet (like durian i guess). it's a short song with idk what progression is that but i played D shaped chord and some Bdim Bass formed by a messed up G chord, but it sounds sweet. i can say that im proud of this one, I really want to make a game from this song, or put this song in a game (which one come first).<br>
