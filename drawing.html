                Hillarious isn't it?. This is a cartoonish hitler, im re-using crop1belief's hitler picture to create logo. This logo is intended to complete my hacktiv8 website project. <b>TheGasChamber</b> is a, mockup e-commerce website, since one of our team member was studying and working in Germany, i decided to make a pun or lame joke about Hitler, and so the jokes become ideas, we sell gas, we use Hitler as our logo. you can visit the mockup web with links below<br><br></P>

            <P class="paragraph"> Another infamous banner :D. This one used as our mock-up website banner. Since i love dad jokes and pun, i put some as core value of our mock-up company. ill explain them <br>
                1. Deadly Sales<br>
                Yeah its mean the price is super cheap that it kill our competitor.<br>
                2.Blitzkriegly Fast<br>
                You know, Hitler using this strategy to win most of war with this super short,fast and powerful strategy, so we adopt this strategy as one of our mockup company core value.<br>
                3. Reich Quality<br>
                This one is my favourite, because its a pun in Rich Quality, but also mean Realm in germany, so the quality is for a kingdom or a world.<br>

I put it in a birthday card with poem that i made along with the present. and also first logo that i made in adobe illustrator. The concept is super simple i made it from a box and rotate them 90 degree so it shapes like diamond, and i start carve G and V initial.  <br><br></P>
